# python-cli-number-guessing-game
 The number guessing game lets the computer choose a random number within a range (e.g., 1-100). The user must guess the number within limited attempts. Feedback like "Too high" or "Too low" helps guide guesses. If guessed correctly, the user wins; otherwise, the game ends when attempts run out, revealing the correct number.
